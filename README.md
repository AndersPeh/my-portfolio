I am actively developing my skills in React (Typescipt) and .Net (C#) by building a personal project, which is a platform designed to help students connect with other students from different universities. 
I am currently seeking a software development internship and am open to relocation. 
I am eager to apply my passion for software development to contribute to organisational projects and use my interpersonal skills to build strong work relationships.
